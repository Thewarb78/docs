Default Token Lifetimes
Proof Token Lifetime:

Default: 7 hours.
Governs operations requiring security validation, such as workflows or API calls.
SAML Token Lifetime (IdP):

Common Default: 1–8 hours, depending on the IdP.
Controls how long the authentication session remains valid before requiring reauthentication.
FedAuth Cookie (FormsTokenLifetime):

Default: 10 hours.
Maintains session persistence without reauthentication.
Recommendation for SAML Token Lifetime
Given that the Proof Token Lifetime is 7 hours, setting the SAML token lifetime to 7 or 8 hours would ensure smooth session behavior and token validation, aligning with the SharePoint defaults.

Why 7–8 Hours?
Avoid Premature Expiry:

If the SAML token expires before the Proof Token, users may experience disruptions when refreshing proof tokens or completing workflows.
Align with Proof Token Lifetime:

Keeping the SAML token lifetime close to the Proof Token Lifetime ensures that sessions expire gracefully without unnecessary prompts.
User Session Consistency:

A typical workday for many users is 7–8 hours. This setting minimizes interruptions while maintaining reasonable security.
Adjustments if Needed
For Higher Security Needs:

Shorten the SAML token lifetime (e.g., 4 hours) and adjust the Proof Token Lifetime or FedAuth cookie accordingly to match security policies.
For Longer Sessions:

If your users need extended uninterrupted sessions (e.g., for overnight jobs or specific workflows), you can increase the Proof Token and SAML token lifetimes (e.g., up to 10 hours).
